# Project Overview

The concept of the "American Dream" often includes the milestone of home ownership. Acquiring a home is not only a significant financial investment but also an essential part of oneâ€™s life journey. However, the process of finding a suitable home that aligns with both personal preferences and budget constraints is challenging. A crucial aspect in this endeavor is understanding house pricing. 

The objective of this project is to create a tool that provides an estimated house price based on readily available information. While acknowledging that several external factors can influence housing prices and the estimation may not be perfect, this tool aims to offer a starting point for potential buyers to engage in price negotiations more informatively. 

The project is structured into three key areas, with a focus on data analysis and the enhancement of data features:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Feature Engineering**
- **Model Development**
