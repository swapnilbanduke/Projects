# Review Scraping and Analysis using Flask, MongoDB, and AWS

This project focuses on automating the process of scraping and analyzing product reviews from Flipkart. By utilizing technologies such as Flask, MongoDB, and AWS, valuable insights can be extracted from customer feedback, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions to enhance their products and improve customer satisfaction.

## Introduction
The project aims to automate the collection and analysis of product reviews from Flipkart. Traditional manual review analysis can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this challenge, the project utilizes web scraping techniques to extract reviews from Flipkart. The scraped data is then stored in a MongoDB database for efficient management. Additionally, a Flask application is developed to create an API that enables easy retrieval and analysis of the collected reviews. Finally, the project is deployed on the AWS cloud infrastructure to ensure scalability and accessibility.

## Problems
- Manual review analysis is time-consuming and requires significant human effort.
- Efficient storage and management of a large volume of review data is crucial.
- Scalability and accessibility of the project need to be addressed for future growth and user convenience.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to automate the review scraping process from Flipkart, store the data in a MongoDB database, and develop a Flask-based API for easy access and analysis of the collected reviews. By achieving these objectives, businesses can gain valuable insights from customer feedback and make data-driven decisions to improve their products.

## Impact and Value
- Customer insights: Analyzing a large dataset of product reviews provides valuable insights into customer preferences, pain points, and opinions. This information helps businesses understand their target market better.
- Product improvements: Identifying common themes and issues raised in reviews allows businesses to address product deficiencies, enhance product quality, and improve customer satisfaction.
- Data-driven decision-making: Having a comprehensive dataset of product reviews empowers businesses to make informed decisions, such as identifying top-performing products, understanding market trends, and monitoring customer satisfaction over time.

## Workflow
1. Web Scraping: Develop a robust web scraping script that retrieves product reviews from Flipkart. Extract relevant information such as review content, ratings, and timestamps.
2. Flask Application: Build a Flask application that acts as an interface between the MongoDB database and users. Create an API that facilitates easy retrieval and analysis of the scraped review data.
3. MongoDB Integration: Establish a connection with a MongoDB database and store the scraped review data in a structured manner. Implement indexing and querying techniques for efficient data retrieval.
4. AWS Deployment: Deploy the project on the AWS cloud infrastructure using services like EC2, S3, and Route 53. Ensure scalability, reliability, and accessibility of the project.

## Conclusion
This project provides an end-to-end solution for automating the review scraping and analysis process using Flask, MongoDB, and AWS. By leveraging these technologies, businesses can gain valuable insights from customer reviews, improve their products, and make data-driven decisions. The project emphasizes efficient data management, scalability, and accessibility to support businesses in extracting meaningful insights from customer feedback.
